# What is Tiki2 by the way?
[Tiki](https://tiki.vn) is a very popular eCommerce site in Vietnam from where I usually get my favorite books.

So **Tiki2** means a clone (but simpler).

# Why did I do this?
I wanted to be challenged with Back-end Web development after had been working mostly on developing desktop application for more than 2 years. 

My colleague (a Software Architect) recommended me [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/microservices-in-net-core) about Microservice. And this project was made as a practical exercise after reading that book. 

Not only the code, you can also find [the document](https://github.com/johnlemon93/tiki2-uservices/wiki) including: requirements, architectures, designs, technologies and some best practices I had learnt. If you are also in or going to be in the same journey to become a Back-end developer, then feel free to take a look at my story.

I hope you enjoy it as an interest of building a simple but end-to-end eCommerce system.

All feedbacks, comments and especially "stars" are welcome :smiley:!
